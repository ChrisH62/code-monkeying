Selection sort
for i from 0 to n-1
    Find smallest number between numbers[i] and numbers[n-1]
    Swap smallest number with  numbers[i]

 Slow/ineffiecient, has to make a lot of comparisons

Bubble Sort
Repeat n - 1 times
for i from 0 to n-2
    If numbers[i] and numbers [i+1] are out of order
    Swap them

If no swaps, Quit
Similarly ineffiecient to Selection

These two basic ones are OK for small lists, but again slow.

Merge Sort
If only one number :Quit
    Else: 
    Sort Left half of numbers
    Sort right half of numbers
    Merge Sorted halves
        compare each half, which number should come first?

    Uses Multiple arrays
    Tradeoff between memory savings and time savings
