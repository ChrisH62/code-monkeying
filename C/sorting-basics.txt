Selection sort
for i from 0 to n-1
    Find smallest number between numbers[i] and numbers[n-1]
    Swap smallest number with  numbers[i]

 Slow/ineffiecient, has to make a lot of comparisons

Bubble Sort
Repeat n - 1 times
for i from 0 to n-2
    If numbers[i] and numbers [i+1] are out of order
    Swap them

If no swaps, Quit
Similarly ineffiecient to Selection

These two basic ones are OK for small lists, but again slow.
