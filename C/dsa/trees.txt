array: [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7]

tree:
                    [4]

            [2]             [6]

        [1]      [3]     [5]      [7]

Root node is at the very top
Leaf node(s) are the ones at the bottom

Each node gets two pointers, to point to the ones "below" them

Leaf node pointers should probably be NULL

Root should be a 'middle' value
